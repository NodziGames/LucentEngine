# LucentEngine
A Game Engine Written in C++ using OpenGL

Welcome to Lucent Engine, a Game Engine written in C++. It's still under development, but here's what it's got so far!

1. Window Management
2. OpenGL and GLEW handling
3. Input Reading
4. Vector Maths

I'll update this readme as I add features, but it's not ready for use yet. If you want to build from here then go for it, it's all yours ;)
